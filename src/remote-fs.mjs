/**
 * Call 1: this host's live pids, then its small files as a tar stream.
 *
 * `/proc` rather than `ps`, so nothing has to know which `ps` the host ships or
 * how it formats columns; `ps -A -o pid=` is the fallback for a remote without
 * `/proc`.
 *
 * **The member list is built positively with `find`, not by excluding a glob.**
 * Two facts force this, both measured against a real host:
 *
 * 1. `tar --exclude` matches with `fnmatch` and *no* `FNM_PATHNAME`, so `*`
 *    crosses `/`. `--exclude='projects/*​/*.jsonl'` therefore also drops
 *    `projects/<slug>/<id>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl` four levels down — the
 *    files `readRunningSubagents` reads. Nothing errors; remote sessions simply
 *    never show a subagent again. The anchored BRE below cannot do this:
 *    `[^/]*` provably does not cross `/`.
 * 2. Excluding only the *live* sessions' transcripts is not enough. A project
 *    directory holds every transcript it has ever had — this host carries a
 *    4.3MB one from a session that ended days ago. The rule has to be "no
 *    depth-2 transcript", not "not these ones".
 *
 * Measured on the live host: 20KB with this list, 4.7MB without it.
 *
 * Subagent transcripts ride along in the tar, with their real mtimes — which
 * `readRunningSubagents` needs, since `SUBAGENT_IDLE_MAX_S` retires an agent
 * that stopped writing. That is why they are not fetched as tails instead.
 *
 * A missing `~/.claude` exits 0 with an empty stream rather than failing: a host
 * you have opened a window on but never run Claude Code on is an ordinary state,
 * not an error.
